            <h3 id="sub1">What are frogs?</h3>
            <p>Frogs are fascinating amphibians that can live both in water and on land. They have smooth, moist skin and come in various colors and sizes. Frogs are known for their big, bulging eyes and powerful hind legs, which they use for jumping and swimming. They start their lives as tiny tadpoles in water, eventually transforming into adult frogs through a process called metamorphosis. Frogs are skilled hunters and mostly eat insects, using their long, sticky tongues to catch prey.. </p>

        <h3>Where to find frogs?</h3>
        <P>Frogs can be found in various places around the world, especially near water. You might spot them by ponds, lakes, rivers, or even in your backyard if there's a small pool or a damp area. They like places with water because that's where they lay their eggs, and their tadpoles grow into frogs. Sometimes, you can hear their croaky sounds at night when they are looking for mates. So, if you want to find frogs, it's a good idea to explore places with water, like ponds or wetlands, and listen for their distinctive calls..  <br>  </P>
